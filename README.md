# SpyApp

Student: Brian Casipit

Language: Swift 4.2

Tested for iOS 11.4

## Overview

Note: This app is still in its early stages.

The main goal of this app is to encode and decrypt messages for the purpose of messaging. This version of the app allows users to:
* choose from a selection of 4 ciphers
* enter a "secret" (in this case, an unsigned integer) to use for their message
* encode with the message field and secret field filled
* decrypt with the message field and secret field filled
* clear all fields

A future version of this app will most likely include the capability to message other users.

## Names Of Current Ciphers

* Cesar
* Alphanumeric Cesar
* Ftn
* Ftn2
